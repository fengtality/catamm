  **A strategic board game combining Settlers of Catan with DeFi-style AMM trading**
</div>

## Overview

CATAMM reimagines resource trading in Settlers of Catan by replacing traditional player-to-player negotiations with Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools. Each port on the board hosts a dynamic market where resources are exchanged using constant product formulas, creating an ever-changing economic landscape.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Pricing**: Resource values fluctuate based on supply and demand
- **Strategic Port Control**: Own a port for 0% trading fees vs 10% for others
- **Ghost Ship Mechanics**: Choose between blocking resources or flipping markets
- **Pure Resource Economy**: No currency tokens - direct resource-to-resource swaps
- **Balanced Gameplay**: 9 active markets from 10 possible pairs ensure variety

## Game Mechanics

### Resources
- Wood (Wo)
- Brick (B) 
- Sheep (S)
- Wheat (Wh)
- Ore (O)

### AMM Markets
- 10 possible resource pair combinations
- 9 ports on the board, each hosting one market
- 1 market always inactive (randomly determined)
- Constant product formula: `x * y = k`

### Port Distribution
- 3 single-edge ports
- 6 double-edge ports
- Strategically placed around the board perimeter

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Early Development** - This is an exploratory repository focused on prototyping core mechanics.

### Current Progress
- âœ… Board layout and hex positioning system
- âœ… Port placement logic
- âœ… Game design documentation
- ðŸ”„ AMM implementation
- ðŸ”„ UI components in TypeScript
- ðŸ“‹ Game balance analysis tools

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React
- **Game Logic**: TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Analysis**: Python
- **Build Tools**: TBD
