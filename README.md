  **A strategic board game combining Settlers of Catan with DeFi-style AMM trading**
</div>

## Overview

CATAMM reimagines resource trading in Settlers of Catan by replacing traditional player-to-player negotiations with Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools. Players can build and own ports that host dynamic markets, creating an ever-changing economic landscape where resource values fluctuate based on supply and demand.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic AMM Markets**: Resource prices fluctuate based on constant product formula (x Ã— y = k)
- **Port Ownership**: Own a port for 0% trading fees vs 10% for others
- **Strategic Placement**: Ports are built on vertices between two different resource hexes
- **Pure Resource Economy**: Direct resource-to-resource swaps without currency tokens
- **Interactive UI**: Modern React/TypeScript interface with real-time market visualization

## Game Mechanics

### Resources
The game features the standard 5 Catan resources:
- Wood (Wo)
- Brick (B) 
- Sheep (S)
- Wheat (Wh)
- Ore (O)

### AMM Markets
- **10 possible markets**: One for each resource pair combination.
- **9 possible port locations**: Players build settlements/cities on portable vertices (a perimeter vertex that joins 2 adjacent hexes) to activate markets
- **Randomized available markets**: The trading pair is defined by the two resources of the port's two adjacent hexes, which randomizes which markets are available
- **Constant product formula**: `x Ã— y = k` maintains market balance
- **Initial liquidity**: Markets start with small reserves that grow through player deposits

### Trading Mechanics
```
Output = (Reserve_out Ã— Input) / (Reserve_in + Input)
```

**Trading Fees**:
- **Port owner**: 0% fee (free trading at your own port)
- **Other players**: 10% fee on all trades
- Fees are taken from input amount before swap calculation

### Building & Victory

**Standard Catan Costs**:
- Road: 1 Wood + 1 Brick
- Settlement: 1 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat
- City: 3 Ore + 2 Wheat
- Development Card: 1 Ore + 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat

**Victory Points** (First to 10 wins):
- Settlement: 1 VP
- City: 2 VP
- Longest Road: 2 VP
- Largest Army: 2 VP
- Victory Point Cards: 1 VP each

### Special Mechanics

**Portable Vertices**: 
- Located on board perimeter between two different resource hexes
- Building here creates an AMM market for those two resources
- Strategic locations that provide trading advantages

**Robber/Ghost Ship** (on roll of 7):
- Traditional robber: Block hex production and steal from a player

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript 5
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components
- **Build Tools**: Vite, PostCSS
- **Board Rendering**: SVG-based hexagonal grid system
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier
- **Python Tools**: Game balance analysis scripts
